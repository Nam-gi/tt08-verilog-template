## How it works

The project shifts an 8-bit input signal right by 10 bits and increments a counter from 0 to 9 when the result is zero, displaying the value on a seven-segment display.

## How to test

Provide an 8-bit input signal and verify that the seven-segment display correctly shows the counter incrementing from 0 to 9.

## External hardware

Requires a seven-segment display for output and a clock signal for timing; no additional hardware is needed.
